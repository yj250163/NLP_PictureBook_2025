"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot trit-trot of a pony  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr mcgregor and beside him sat mrs mcgregor in her best bonnet  as soon as they had passed little benjamin bunny slid down into the road and set off--with a hop skip and a jump--to call upon his relations who lived in the wood at the back of mr mcgregor's garden      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy mopsy cotton-tail and peter  old mrs rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees i once bought a pair at a bazaar she also sold herbs and rosemary tea and rabbit-tobacco which is what we call lavender  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt  he came round the back of the fir-tree and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter      peter was sitting by himself he looked poorly and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief  peter said little benjamin in a whisper who has got your clothes?  peter replied the scarecrow in mr mcgregor's garden and described how he had been chased about the garden and had dropped his shoes and coat  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr mcgregor had gone out in a gig and mrs mcgregor also; and certainly for the day because she was wearing her best bonnet      peter said he hoped that it would rain  at this point old mrs rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk  they went away hand in hand and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood from here they looked down into mr mcgregor's garden peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr mcgregor's      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft  it had been sown with lettuces  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed especially little benjamin who was wearing clogs      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief  they took them off the scarecrow there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes and the coat was somewhat shrunk  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter but it was too big for him  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions as a little present for his aunt  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises       benjamin on the contrary was perfectly at home and ate a lettuce leaf he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner  the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr benjamin bunny  the lettuces certainly were very fine  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home presently he dropped half the onions      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden they went along a little walk on planks under a sunny red brick wall  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again      they got amongst flower-pots and frames and tubs peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look and then in half a minute less than no time he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket      the cat got up and stretched herself and came and sniffed at the basket  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway she sat down upon the top of the basket  she sat there for five hours                                       i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket because it was quite dark and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry  the sun got round behind the wood and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket      at length there was a pitter-patter pitter-patter and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above  the cat looked up and saw old mr benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco and had a little switch in his hand  he was looking for his son  old mr bunny had no opinion whatever of cats  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat and cuffed it off the basket and kicked it into the greenhouse scratching off a handful of fur  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back      when old mr bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse he locked the door  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears and whipped him with the little switch  then he took out his nephew peter  then he took out the handkerchief of onions and marched out of the garden    when mr mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse locking the door upon the outside      when peter got home his mother forgave him because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief and old mrs rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco"@" benjamin bunny@"beatrix potter"

            a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs    her sister-in-law mrs rebeccah puddle-duck was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you jemima you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself quacked jemima puddle-duck    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate she determined to make a nest right away from the farm    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet    when she reached the top of the hill she saw a wood in the distance  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl and then she jumped off into the air    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood where the trees and brushwood had been cleared    jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves  but--seated upon the stump she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers  quack? said jemima puddle-duck with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam have you lost your way? said he he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon as the stump was somewhat damp  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome she explained that she had not lost her way but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers looking curiously at jemima he folded up the newspaper and put it in his coat-tail pocket  jemima complained of the superfluous hen  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed no my dear madam you will be in nobody's way you may sit there as long as you like said the bushy long-tailed gentleman  he led the way to a very retired dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves  it was built of faggots and turf and there were two broken pails one on top of another by way of a chimney    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient said the hospitable gentleman  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house made of old soap-boxes the gentleman opened the door and showed jemima in    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all    when she came out the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out but he was looking over the top of it  he was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest they were greeny white and very large the foxy gentleman admired them immensely he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched they might catch cold said the conscientious jemima    madam i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats but before you commence your tedious sitting i intend to give you a treat let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme and mint and two onions and some parsley i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious  she went round the farm-garden nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck    and she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket  the collie-dog kep met her coming out what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story  the collie listened with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers    he asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed  then he went out and trotted down the village he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time on a sunny afternoon she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag  she flew over the wood and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood when jemima alighted he quite jumped  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs give me the herbs for the omelette be sharp!  he was rather abrupt jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that  she felt surprised and uncomfortable    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door and then locked it  jemima became much alarmed    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking baying growls and howls squealing and groans  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman  presently kep opened the door of the shed and let out jemima puddle-duck    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs    she laid some more in june and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter"@" jemima puddle-duck@"beatrix potter"

  once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie who lived at a farm called little-town she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn clucking--  i go barefoot barefoot barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile and away  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring bubbling out from the hill-side  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person  lucie ran on and on    the path ended under a big rock the grass was short and green and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems with lines of plaited rushes and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean oh!      with little frills between oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen oh!    lucie knocked--once--twice and interrupted the song a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small and so was everything there    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie  her print gown was tucked up and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat her little black nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh yes if you please'm; my name is mrs tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket and spread it on the ironing-blanket    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it and put it on one side    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie  oh no if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs tiggy-winkle    mrs tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs tiggy-winkle ironed it and goffered it and shook out the frills  oh that is lovely! said lucie    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs tiggy-winkle    why there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately i can't get out the smell  there's another one of mine said lucie    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs tiggy-winkle now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl  will their jackets take off? asked lucie  oh yes if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder and here's one marked for gatesgarth and three that come from little-town they're always marked at washing! said mrs tiggy-winkle    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat not marked that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another mrs tiggy-winkle's hand holding the tea-cup was very very brown and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her    when they had finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny and fastened with a silver safety-pin  and then they made up the fire with turf and came out and locked the door and hid the key under the door-sill    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs tiggy-winkle    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog                                           now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs tiggy-winkle!"@" mrs tiggy-winkle@"beatrix potter"

" once upon a time there were three little kittens and their names were mittens tom kitten and moppet  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust  but one day their mother--mrs tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors to wash and dress them before the fine company arrived      first she scrubbed their faces this one is moppet  then she brushed their fur this one is mittens      then she combed their tails and whiskers this is tom kitten  tom was very naughty and he scratched  mrs tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers in order to dress up her son thomas      tom kitten was very fat and he had grown; several buttons burst off his mother sewed them on again  when the three kittens were ready mrs tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast  now keep your frocks clean children! you must walk on your hind legs keep away from the dirty ash-pit and from sally henny penny and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall said moppet  they turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers he came up the rockery by degrees breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off and the rest of his buttons burst      while they were in difficulties there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens they had very small eyes and looked surprised      then the two duck-birds rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck picked up the hat and tucker and put them on  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down  come! mr drake puddle-duck said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten  it's a very fine morning! said mr drake puddle-duck      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road keeping step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on      she pulled them off the wall smacked them and took them back to the house  my friends will arrive in a minute and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted said mrs tabitha twitchit  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party  and i think that some day i shall have to make another larger book to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond  the clothes all came off directly because there were no buttons      and mr drake puddle-duck and jemima and rebeccah have been looking for them ever since"@" tom kitten@"beatrix potter"
