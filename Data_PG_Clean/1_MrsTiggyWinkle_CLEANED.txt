  once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie who lived at a farm called little-town she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn clucking--  i go barefoot barefoot barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile and away  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring bubbling out from the hill-side  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person  lucie ran on and on    the path ended under a big rock the grass was short and green and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems with lines of plaited rushes and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean oh!      with little frills between oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen oh!    lucie knocked--once--twice and interrupted the song a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small and so was everything there    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie  her print gown was tucked up and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat her little black nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh yes if you please'm; my name is mrs tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket and spread it on the ironing-blanket    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it and put it on one side    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie  oh no if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs tiggy-winkle    mrs tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs tiggy-winkle ironed it and goffered it and shook out the frills  oh that is lovely! said lucie    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs tiggy-winkle    why there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately i can't get out the smell  there's another one of mine said lucie    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs tiggy-winkle now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl  will their jackets take off? asked lucie  oh yes if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder and here's one marked for gatesgarth and three that come from little-town they're always marked at washing! said mrs tiggy-winkle    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat not marked that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another mrs tiggy-winkle's hand holding the tea-cup was very very brown and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her    when they had finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny and fastened with a silver safety-pin  and then they made up the fire with turf and came out and locked the door and hid the key under the door-sill    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs tiggy-winkle    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog                                           now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs tiggy-winkle!@the tale of mrs tiggy-winkle@beatrix potter
