JOHNNY CROW'S GARDEN.


Johnny Crow
Would dig and sow

Till he made a little Garden.

And the Lion

Had a green and yellow Tie on

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Rat
Wore a Feather in his Hat

But the Bear
Had nothing to wear

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

So the Ape

Took his Measure with a Tape

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

Then the Crane

Was caught in the Rain

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Beaver
Was afraid he had a Fever

But the Goat
Said:

"It's nothing but his Throat!"

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Pig
Danced a Jig

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

Then the Stork
Gave a Philosophic Talk

Till the Hippopotami
Said: "Ask no further 'What am I?'"

While the Elephant
Said something quite irrelevant

And the Goose--
Well,

the Goose _was_ a Goose

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Mouse

Built himself a little House

Where the Cat

Sat down beside the Mat

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Whale

Told a very long Tale

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Owl
Was a funny old Fowl

And the Fox

Put them all in the Stocks

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

But Johnny Crow
He let them go

And they all sat down
to their dinner in a row

In Johnny Crow's Garden.



"GOOD-BYE!"
